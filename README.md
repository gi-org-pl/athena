### Meet the standards

Before you start, make sure you have read and understood the following documents:

- [GI Tech Standards](https://github.com/Generacja-Innowacja/gi-tech-standards)
- [Before start GitHub configuration](https://github.com/Generacja-Innowacja/gi-tech-standards/blob/main/docs/github/INDEX.md)

## Infrastructure

This is a frontend-only library that runs locally using Vite development server.

## Setting project up

This app uses Node.js and Yarn package manager. In order to set up project, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js (v24.x or higher):
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

2. Install Yarn globally:

   ```shell
   npm install --global yarn@^1.22
   ```

3. Clone project by running:

   ```shell
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd athena
   ```

5. Install dependencies using Yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the project

To start storybook development server:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

## Available scripts

```bash
yarn build            # Build for production
yarn test             # Run unit tests with Vitest
yarn test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage report
yarn lint             # Run Biome linter
yarn lint:fix         # Fix linting issues automatically
yarn storybook        # Run Storybook in development mode
yarn storybook:build  # Build Storybook for production
```

## How to create new components?

1. Find a matching `shadcn` component in the [shadcn components library](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)

2. Create a new component with use of `shadcn` and `npx`

    Example: `npx shadcn@latest add button`

3. Adjust component structure to [the standard](https://github.com/Generacja-Innowacja/gi-tech-standards/blob/main/docs/frontend/conventions/COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md)

4. Add unit tests and storybook stories

5. Export new component in the [main.ts file](src\main.ts)

## Build

This project uses Vite for building the library. The build process generates optimized static assets for production deployment.

Build the project with `yarn build`, you'll see the built library in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

This library uses Vitest with React Testing Library for component and utility testing

Run tests with:

```bash
yarn test              # Run unit tests
yarn test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage
```

## Linting

This library uses BiomeJS for code linting and formatting. Biome is a fast, all-in-one toolchain that replaces ESLint, Prettier, and other tools.

- **Linter**: BiomeJS provides fast linting with TypeScript support
- **Formatter**: Built-in code formatter with consistent style
- **Import Organization**: Automatic import sorting and organization

Run linting with:

```bash
yarn lint              # Check for linting issues
yarn lint:fix          # Automatically fix linting and formatting issues
```

The project is configured with custom linting rules in `biome.json`, including complexity checks, style rules, and correctness validations for TypeScript files.

## Visual testing

This library uses Storybook for visual testing and component development. Storybook provides an isolated environment to develop, test, and document UI components independently.

- **Component Development**: Build and test components in isolation
- **Visual Testing**: Preview components with different props and states
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate component documentation from stories
- **Addons**: Includes accessibility, docs, and Vitest integration addons

Run Storybook with:

```bash
yarn storybook        # Start Storybook development server (http://localhost:6006)
yarn storybook:build  # Build Storybook for production deployment
```
